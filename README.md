# ai-usagebar

Native Omarchy Quattro panel, Waybar widget, and tabbed TUI for AI plan usage across **Claude**, **Codex/ChatGPT**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Z.AI (GLM)**, **OpenRouter**, **DeepSeek**, **Kimi**, **Nous Research**, **OpenCode Go**, **Command Code**, and other supported AI coding services.

ai-usagebar began as a Rust port of
[`claudebar`](https://github.com/mryll/claudebar) and remains drop-in
compatible. It keeps claudebar's Pango tooltip, Omarchy theme detection, and
flock-protected OAuth refresh while adding more providers and a testable Rust
codebase.

## Features

- Per-provider Waybar modules use the same JSON shape and flags as claudebar.
- The native Omarchy Quattro plugin follows the shell theme and supports
  keyboard navigation, provider switching, live reset timers, and stale/error
  states.
- `ai-usagebar-tui` opens with a compact provider overview and refreshes every
  60 seconds. Its navigation can use a sidebar, navbar, or no vendor box.
- An optional Claude Code context view reads recent local session usage without
  scanning entire histories.
- Native integrations are available for Omarchy, GNOME Shell, KDE Plasma 6, and
  the macOS menu bar.
- One bar item can cycle through enabled providers. `[ui] primary` controls the
  initial provider in both the widget and TUI.
- Atomic caches and file locking prevent duplicate requests from multi-monitor
  Waybar setups.
- Network failures keep the previous data visible; HTTP errors appear in the
  tooltip.
- `--pretty`, `--watch N`, and `make smoke` help with local testing and API
  response changes.

## Install

### Nix

Run either application directly from GitHub:

```bash
nix run github:akitaonrails/ai-usagebar
nix run github:akitaonrails/ai-usagebar#tui
```

Install both `ai-usagebar` and `ai-usagebar-tui` into your user profile:

```bash
nix profile install github:akitaonrails/ai-usagebar
```

For a flake-based NixOS or Home Manager configuration, add the input in your
root `flake.nix`:

```nix
inputs.ai-usagebar.url = "github:akitaonrails/ai-usagebar";
```

Pass `inputs` to your NixOS modules with `specialArgs`:

```nix
nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
  system = "x86_64-linux";
  specialArgs = { inherit inputs; };
  modules = [ ./configuration.nix ];
}
```

For standalone Home Manager, use `extraSpecialArgs`:

```nix
let
  system = "x86_64-linux";
in
home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
  pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
  extraSpecialArgs = { inherit inputs; };
  modules = [ ./home.nix ];
}
```

If your configuration already passes `inputs` through these arguments, you do
not need to add it again. Then consume the package in a NixOS module:

```nix
{ inputs, pkgs, ... }:
{
  environment.systemPackages = [
    inputs.ai-usagebar.packages.${pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform.system}.default
  ];
}
```

The equivalent Home Manager module is:

```nix
{ inputs, pkgs, ... }:
{
  home.packages = [
    inputs.ai-usagebar.packages.${pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform.system}.default
  ];
}
```

Alternatively, apply the overlay when you want the package available as
`pkgs.ai-usagebar`:

```nix
{ inputs, pkgs, ... }:
{
  nixpkgs.overlays = [ inputs.ai-usagebar.overlays.default ];
  environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.ai-usagebar ];
}
```

### Omarchy Quattro

The native plugin is a display frontend and does not bundle the
`ai-usagebar` executable. Install the binary first, then add and enable the
plugin:

```bash
omarchy pkg aur add ai-usagebar-bin
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-usagebar.git --enable
```

Quattro enables its own `omarchy.agents` status widget by default. Disable it
if you want AI Usage to be the only agent status item in the bar:

```bash
omarchy plugin disable omarchy.agents
```

Once enabled, **left-click the AI Usage widget** to open the native Quattro
usage panel. From that panel, click the **gear** or press `s` to open the native
QML settings page. **Right-click intentionally opens `ai-usagebar-tui` in a
terminal**; it is not the settings shortcut. Middle-click or use the mouse
wheel to switch providers. In QML settings, turn off **Show usage value in the
top bar** for an icon-only widget; the panel and tooltip keep the full details.
Turn on **Show provider name in the top bar** to prefix the entry with the same
three-letter code Waybar's `{vendor_short}` prints, so a bar cycling several
providers says which one it is showing.

The source-built `ai-usagebar` AUR package can replace `ai-usagebar-bin` in
the first command.

### Arch (AUR)

Two packages. Pick one:

```bash
yay -S ai-usagebar-bin    # prebuilt binary from GitHub Releases (fast, ~5s install)
yay -S ai-usagebar        # compiles from source (~30-60s, hermetic)
```

The `-bin` variant downloads the same x86_64 ELF that CI built and tested. The source variant compiles locally with your toolchain. Both install identical binaries to `/usr/bin/`. If you already have one installed, switch with `yay -S` the other package; pacman handles the swap through `conflicts`/`provides`.

### Other Linux / macOS (crates.io)

```bash
cargo install ai-usagebar                # compile from source (needs rustup)
cargo binstall ai-usagebar               # download prebuilt binary (needs cargo-binstall, no rustup)
```

`cargo binstall` fetches the same x86_64 / aarch64 Linux tarball the AUR `-bin` package uses. Both install `ai-usagebar` + `ai-usagebar-tui` to `~/.cargo/bin/`.

### From source

```bash
cargo build --release
sudo make install                  # → /usr/local/bin
# or
make install PREFIX=$HOME/.local   # → ~/.local/bin
```

### Windows

The **Waybar widget is Wayland-only and does not apply to Windows.** The
**`ai-usagebar-tui`** binary, however, runs natively, and `ai-usagebar --json`
/ `--pretty` work too (handy for feeding a custom tray/widget). Build with a
standard Rust toolchain:

```powershell
cargo build --release
# binaries land in target\release\ai-usagebar.exe and ai-usagebar-tui.exe
```

Credentials are read from the Windows user profile rather than `$HOME`:
`%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json` (Anthropic) and
`%USERPROFILE%\.codex\auth.json` (OpenAI Codex). Run the official `claude` /
`codex` CLI once on Windows to populate them, exactly as on Linux/macOS.
API-key vendors work unchanged via environment variables or `config.toml`.

## Authentication

Claude and Codex reuse OAuth credentials from their official CLIs. Other
providers use API keys, an existing app login, or a local service. API keys can
come from environment variables or `config.toml`.

| Vendor | Method | Action required |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | OAuth from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` or the macOS login Keychain | Run `claude` once. Tokens refresh automatically. |
| Anthropic API | Organization Admin key | Opt in with `ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY` or `[anthropic_api] api_key`. Inference and Claude Code keys do not work. |
| Codex | OAuth, read from `~/.codex/auth.json` | Run `codex login` once. Token auto-refreshes. |
| GitHub Copilot | GitHub CLI OAuth | Run `gh auth login --web`, then choose GitHub Copilot as the primary provider in Settings. ai-usagebar gets the token only with `gh auth token`; `GITHUB_COPILOT_TOKEN` is an optional explicit override. |
| Z.AI | API key (`ZAI_API_KEY` env or `[zai] api_key` in config) | Set either. |
| OpenRouter | API key (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` env or `[openrouter] api_key` in config) | Set either. Named keys are supported. |
| DeepSeek | API key (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` or config) | Set either and opt in. |
| Kimi | Existing Kimi Code CLI login **or** API key (`KIMI_API_KEY` or config) | Opt in, then either log in with `kimi` (nothing to paste) or set an API key, which wins when present. A Kimi For Coding subscription can issue one at kimi.com/code/console. |
| Kilo | API key (`KILO_API_KEY` env or `[kilo] api_key` in config) | Set either. Opt-in. For a team balance, also set `[kilo] organization_id`; omit it for the personal balance. |
| Novita | API key (`NOVITA_API_KEY` env or `[novita] api_key` in config) | Set either. Opt-in. |
| Moonshot | API key (`MOONSHOT_API_KEY` or config) | Opt in. Set region `cn` for CNY; `global` uses USD. |
| Grok (xAI) | Management key | Opt in with `XAI_MANAGEMENT_KEY` or config. An inference key does not work. |
| SuperGrok | Existing `grok login` (its `auth.json` key, or its ACP extension) | Opt in, install Grok Build, and run `grok login`. This reports subscription usage, not the Management API balance. |
| MiniMax | Token Plan subscription key | Opt in with `MINIMAX_API_KEY` or config. Choose the matching global or China region; pay-as-you-go keys do not work. |
| Google Antigravity | Local Antigravity server | Opt in and keep Antigravity or an interactive `agy` session running. |
| Cursor | Existing Cursor IDE or `cursor-agent` login | Opt in and sign in once. `cursor-agent` is the headless fallback. |
| Kiro CLI | Existing kiro-cli login | Opt in and run `kiro-cli login` once. ai-usagebar refreshes the session when needed. |
| Nous Research | OAuth device flow | Enable `[nous]`, click **Log in with Nous Research** in the Omarchy settings panel, or run `ai-usagebar auth nous login`. Credentials are kept in ai-usagebar's separate platform config directory (`~/.config/ai-usagebar/credentials.json` on Linux). |
| OpenCode Go | API key (`OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY` env or `[opencode-go] api_key` in config) | Enable `[opencode-go]`, then enter the key in the Omarchy settings panel or set the environment variable. |
| Command Code | Existing `commandcode` or pi login | Enable `[commandcode]` and sign in to either one once. No key to paste; `COMMANDCODE_API_KEY` overrides if you prefer one. |

### Nous credits and OpenCode Go

Nous usage percentage is calculated from the subscription-credit pool only:
`(monthly subscription credits - subscription credits remaining) / monthly subscription credits`.
Top-up/purchased credits are not mixed into that percentage. When the Portal
reports them, the tooltip and TUI show subscription credits, top-up credits, and
total usable credits as separate values.

Nous login is interactive because the device code is authorized in the browser.
Leave the terminal open until it reports that login completed, then refresh the
Omarchy panel. The login never reads Hermes Agent credentials. On Unix, newly
created credential directories use mode `0700`, and credential and lock files
use mode `0600`; an existing current-user-owned config directory also works when
it is not group- or world-writable. Windows uses the user's platform config
directory and inherited per-user access controls.

OpenCode Go uses the official usage endpoint and the `percent` field. Its key can
be entered through the native Settings panel; stored values are sent to the Rust
settings command over stdin and are never placed in QML command arguments. Cache
entries are tied to the endpoint and a one-way key fingerprint, so changing
accounts cannot reuse another account's fresh or stale usage.

### Command Code

Command Code meters spend rather than tokens, so its two rolling windows are
priced in dollars: `$1.23 of $14.00` for the 5-hour window and `$5.24 of $35.00`
for the weekly one. The monthly credit allowance renders as a third window with
the derived spend against the plan's pool and a reset countdown from the
subscription's billing period end.

**There is no key to enter, and no key field in the settings panel.**
Command Code appears in the provider selector but not in the key list, the same
way Claude, Codex, Cursor and Kiro do — enable `[commandcode]` and it works.

Credentials are reused, never issued. The OAuth token comes from
`~/.commandcode/auth.json` from the official CLI first, then
`~/.pi/agent/auth.json`; `COMMANDCODE_API_KEY` outranks both. **The token is
only ever read.**
Refreshing it belongs to the CLI that owns the file, and writing back from here
would race the harnesses that share it; an expired token is reported as expired
instead. Set `[commandcode] auth_paths` to search somewhere else entirely.

The plan's monthly allowance is not reported by the API, so a small table maps
the plan id to it (GOAT → $70, and so on). An unrecognised plan keeps its id
and simply omits the "spent of allowance" line rather than inventing a
denominator. Cache entries are tied to the endpoint and a one-way token
fingerprint, so changing accounts cannot reuse another account's usage.

#### Grok: team-scoped vs organization-scoped keys

The balance lives at `/v1/billing/teams/{team}/prepaid/balance`, so a team has to
be identified. With a **team-scoped** management key the team is read
automatically from the key. An **organization-scoped** key cannot provide it
because that key's `scopeId` is an organization id rather than a team. Set the
team explicitly in that case:

```toml
[grok]
team_id = "your-team-id"
```

Without it, an organization-scoped key reports an error saying exactly this
rather than silently querying the wrong URL.

### Enabling a vendor

`enabled = true` is what makes a vendor fetch. Anthropic API, GitHub Copilot,
DeepSeek, Kimi, Kilo, Novita, Moonshot, Grok, SuperGrok, Antigravity, Cursor,
MiniMax, and Kiro CLI all default to **disabled** so that existing
installs are unaffected until you opt in. Use either method:

- Use the gear or `s` in the Omarchy panel, or run
  `ai-usagebar-tui` and press `s`. Saving a non-empty API key sets that vendor's
  `enabled = true` for you. Clearing it removes the inline key from
  `config.toml`.
- Add `enabled = true` to the vendor's config section alongside the key.

The primary-vendor selector only offers enabled vendors, except GitHub Copilot:
after signing in with GitHub CLI, selecting it as primary explicitly enables
`[copilot]` at the same time.

Vendors that authenticate through a local login rather than a key — Cursor,
Kiro CLI, SuperGrok, Antigravity, and Kimi when you have a Kimi For Coding
subscription — have no key to save, so enable them with `enabled = true` in
`config.toml`.

GitHub Copilot has no token field in the Omarchy or terminal Settings forms.
Run `gh auth login --web`, then select **GitHub Copilot** under **Primary
Provider** and save. That enables `[copilot]` and sets it as primary, making it
fetchable. At fetch time ai-usagebar runs only the fixed, structured
`gh auth token` command; it never parses GitHub CLI configuration, credential
stores, editor state, or browser state, and never writes the token to config or
cache. `GITHUB_COPILOT_TOKEN` is an optional explicit environment override and
takes precedence over GitHub CLI OAuth.

### Credential resolution order (for API-key vendors)

For each API-key vendor, ai-usagebar checks in this order:

1. A non-empty environment variable named by `api_key_env`.
2. An inline `api_key` in the same config section.
3. An error that names both missing options.

### Security

- Inline keys belong in `~/.config/ai-usagebar/config.toml` at mode `600`.
  Redact them before committing that file to dotfiles. Environment variables
  remain the default and avoid storing keys in the config.
- Claude and Codex credentials stay in files managed by their official CLIs.
- SuperGrok credentials stay inside Grok Build. ai-usagebar reads the login's
  `key` from `auth.json` and uses it in the outgoing `Authorization` headers
  of the billing request and the remaining-resets RPC; it never copies,
  caches, refreshes, or writes that key back. Auth/config files are also
  hashed as opaque bytes to separate caches between logins.
- Cursor's `state.vscdb` and `cursor-agent` fallback `auth.json` are read-only.
- kiro-cli's `data.sqlite3` is read-only. Refreshed credentials go to an
  account-scoped `kiro/oauth.json` file, mode `600` on Unix.

#### macOS: Claude credentials in the Keychain

Recent Claude Code builds store OAuth credentials in the macOS login Keychain
instead of `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. No setup is needed: ai-usagebar uses
macOS's `security` tool to read and refresh the `Claude Code-credentials` item.

- The default account still uses an existing credentials file when one is
  present.
- Each scoped `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` login gets its own
  `Claude Code-credentials-<hash>` Keychain item.
- Named accounts use the scoped Keychain item on macOS and fall back to their
  credentials file on Linux.

## Known issues

### macOS: repeated Keychain prompts for Claude Code (#148)

**Affects every release up to and including 1.10.0, on macOS only.**

When ai-usagebar refreshes the Claude OAuth token it writes the result back to
the login Keychain through the native Security.framework API. That marks the
`Claude Code-credentials` item as belonging to ai-usagebar's own code signature
(`cdhash:…`). Claude Code reads the same item with `/usr/bin/security`, whose
partition is `apple-tool:`, so from the next launch onward every read raises a
Keychain permission dialog — once per `claude` process, which means bursts of
them across subagents, `claude -p` jobs and IDE integrations.

`securityd` logs it as `ACL partition mismatch`. **"Always Allow" does not
help**: it edits the trusted-application list, not the partition list.

To clear it, sign in to Claude Code again:

```
claude
/login
```

Claude Code recreates the item through `security`, restoring the `apple-tool:`
partition. Note that ai-usagebar's next token write-back reintroduces the
problem, so this is relief rather than a cure.

To stop it recurring until the fix ships, set `enabled = false` under
`[anthropic]` in `config.toml`. That removes Claude from the panel and from the
automatic refresh cycle, so nothing writes to the Keychain. An explicit
`ai-usagebar --vendor anthropic` still fetches — `--vendor` overrides the
enabled flag by design — so avoid that too while the workaround is in place.

A fix — writing through `security(1)` so the writer and reader share a
partition — is being worked on in [#148]. Linux is unaffected: there the
credential is a file, not a Keychain item.

[#148]: https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-usagebar/issues/148

## Configuration

The optional config file is `~/.config/ai-usagebar/config.toml`. Claude,
Codex, Z.AI, and OpenRouter are enabled by default; other providers are
opt-in.

A minimal example:

```toml
[ui]
primary = "openai"

[kimi]
enabled = true
# api_key = "..."  # or set KIMI_API_KEY
```

See the [configuration reference](docs/configuration.md) for every provider,
display option, account path, region, and API-key setting.

## Quick start

```bash
# Local testing — auto-detects TTY and renders human-readable output.
ai-usagebar                        # uses [ui] primary (defaults to anthropic)
ai-usagebar --vendor anthropic_api
ai-usagebar --vendor openai
ai-usagebar --vendor copilot
ai-usagebar --vendor zai
ai-usagebar --vendor openrouter
ai-usagebar --vendor deepseek
ai-usagebar --vendor kimi
ai-usagebar --vendor kiro

# Force Waybar JSON (e.g. piping into jq).
ai-usagebar --json

# Everything at once: quota + time-to-reset for every configured vendor,
# with one entry per named Claude account.
ai-usagebar usage
ai-usagebar usage --json | jq '.entries[] | {id, metrics, sections}'

# Live preview while iterating on --format / --tooltip-format.
ai-usagebar --vendor openrouter --watch 5

# Interactive TUI with tabs.
ai-usagebar-tui
```

The JSON report has two views of each provider:

- `metrics` contains percentage gauges only.
- `sections` preserves the complete ordered display, including balances,
  grouped rows, and spacers. Rows without a percentage do not invent one.

The report also includes the configured `primary` id. Each entry has
`display_name`, `short_name`, `status`, `stale`, and `fetched_at`; metric rows
may add `severity` and an absolute `reset_at`. These fields are additive, so
existing consumers remain compatible. `short_name` is the same three-letter
code `{vendor_short}` prints, so a frontend that wants a compact provider tag
takes it from the report instead of keeping its own table.

## Standalone TUI

The TUI does not depend on Waybar. Run it directly in a local terminal, over
SSH, or in a tmux pane:

```bash
ai-usagebar-tui                    # opens in your current terminal
```

It works in Kitty, Alacritty, Foot, Ghostty, and other terminal emulators. The
controls and Settings overlay are the same everywhere; no compositor or window
manager integration is required.

## Native desktop integrations

### Omarchy Quattro

Omarchy 4's Quattro shell can host ai-usagebar as a native Quickshell plugin.
Follow the two-step [Omarchy installation](#omarchy-quattro) above; adding the
plugin alone does not install its binary dependency.

Update or remove the plugin without editing `shell.json` by hand:

```bash
omarchy plugin update akitaonrails.ai-usagebar
omarchy plugin remove akitaonrails.ai-usagebar
```

The widget reads the providers and accounts already enabled in
`~/.config/ai-usagebar/config.toml`; it does not keep another copy of API keys.

- Left-click opens the native panel.
- The gear or `s` opens QML settings.
- QML settings can hide the bar's percentage or balance for an icon-only
  widget; this applies immediately and preserves the full panel and tooltip.
- QML settings can also show the provider's `{vendor_short}` code before that
  value (`cld 29%`). It is off by default and applies immediately.
- Right-click launches the TUI.
- Middle-click or the mouse wheel switches providers.
- The selected provider or named account is remembered across shell reloads
  and sleep/unlock cycles. If it is later disabled, the configured primary is
  used instead.

The [Omarchy plugin guide](omarchy/README.md) covers keyboard controls,
credential handling, updates, and development checks.

The plugin depends only on the `ai-usagebar` executable. It runs the fixed
`ai-usagebar usage --json` command for reports and starts `ai-usagebar-tui`
only after a right-click. It installs no service, asks for no elevated
privileges, and does not overwrite user configuration.

### GNOME, KDE and macOS

| Integration | Supported providers | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [macOS menu bar](macos/README.md) | Claude, Codex, Z.AI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Kimi, Kilo, Novita, Moonshot, Grok (xAI), Anthropic API, Cursor, Google Antigravity | Thirteen providers. |
| [GNOME Shell](gnome-extension/README.md) | Claude, Codex, Z.AI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Google Antigravity | Antigravity's two quota pools appear as grouped rows. |
| [KDE Plasma 6](kde-plasmoid/README.md) | Whatever `usage --json` reports | Provider tabs in the popup; vendor is per applet instance. |

Cursor is not available in the GNOME extension yet. On GNOME, use
`ai-usagebar --vendor cursor` or open the TUI.

## Community integrations

External projects built on `ai-usagebar usage --json`. They live in their own
repositories and are maintained by their authors, not here.

- [cosmic-applet-ai-usage](https://github.com/jacksonsieben/cosmic-applet-ai-usage)
  — panel applet for the COSMIC desktop.

- [AI Usage for Noctalia](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/community-plugins/tree/main/ai-usagebar)
  — bar widget and panel for the Noctalia v5 shell, installable from its
  plugin browser as `felipeartur/ai-usagebar`.

## Waybar config

### Single module, scroll-to-cycle (recommended)

Use one bar item and scroll through your vendors. The TUI on-click still shows them all:

```jsonc
"modules-right": ["custom/aibar", ...],

"custom/aibar": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --format '{vendor_short} {session_pct}% · {session_reset}'",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 300,
    "signal": 13,
    "tooltip": true,
    "on-click": "ai-usagebar-tui",
    "on-scroll-up":   "ai-usagebar --cycle-next",
    "on-scroll-down": "ai-usagebar --cycle-prev"
}
```

`{vendor_short}` identifies the active provider with a three-letter code. For a
format shared by every cycled provider, use `{session_pct}`,
`{session_reset}`, `{weekly_pct}`, and `{weekly_reset}`. Cursor maps its two
usage pools to the session and weekly slots; Kiro maps its single pool to both.
The [placeholder reference](docs/format-placeholders.md) lists every generic
and provider-specific field.

`signal: 13` lets the scroll commands refresh the bar through `SIGRTMIN+13`
instead of waiting for the next interval.

The [KDE plasmoid](kde-plasmoid/README.md) has the same gesture in its own
settings and never reads or writes the state file this section relies on.

If a tray expander follows `custom/aibar`, the usage text may sit too close to
its icon. Add right padding in Waybar CSS:

```css
#custom-aibar {
    padding-right: 18px;
}
```

### Per-vendor modules

If you'd rather see them all at once:

```jsonc
"modules-right": ["custom/claude", "custom/openai", "custom/openrouter", "custom/zai", "custom/deepseek", "custom/kimi"],

"custom/claude": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --vendor anthropic --icon '󰚩'",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 300,
    "tooltip": true,
    "on-click": "ai-usagebar-tui"
},
"custom/openai": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --vendor openai --icon '󱢆'",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 300,
    "tooltip": true
},
"custom/openrouter": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --vendor openrouter --icon '󱙺' --format '{or_balance} · {or_used_today}'",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 600,
    "tooltip": true
},
"custom/zai": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --vendor zai --icon '󰚩'",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 300,
    "tooltip": true
},
"custom/deepseek": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --vendor deepseek --icon '󰧑'",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 600,
    "tooltip": true
},
"custom/kimi": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --vendor kimi --icon '󰚩'",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 600,
    "tooltip": true
}
```

> Why 300s? The Anthropic and OpenAI Codex endpoints are undocumented and rate-limit aggressively below ~300s. The cache TTL is 60s so multi-monitor instances coexist, but Waybar's polling interval should stay at 300s.

### Multiple Codex accounts

Two ChatGPT subscriptions, each its own login:

```bash
CODEX_HOME=~/.codex-work codex login
```

```toml
[[openai.accounts]]
label = "work"
codex_auth_path = "~/.codex-work/auth.json"
```

```bash
ai-usagebar --vendor openai --account work
```

Each account keeps its own cache and refreshes independently. Without
`--account`, the default `codex_auth_path` login is used exactly as before.

### Multiple Claude accounts

Named accounts appear as separate TUI tabs and report entries. The recommended
setup is:

```bash
ai-usagebar account add work
ai-usagebar --vendor anthropic --account work
```

On macOS, the same account command can also capture and switch the active
Claude Desktop or CLI login. The dedicated
[Claude account guide](docs/claude-accounts.md) covers:

- explicit and auto-discovered accounts;
- safe credential and cache isolation;

### Multiple OpenRouter accounts

Add one `[[openrouter.accounts]]` entry per key, then select it with
`--vendor openrouter --account <label>`. Named accounts appear separately in
the TUI, native integrations, and `usage` reports. Each has its own cache, so
one key's fresh data cannot be shown for another. See the
[OpenRouter account guide](docs/openrouter-accounts.md) for the config and
Waybar examples.

## Hyprland: float the TUI window

By default Hyprland tiles the TUI. To make `ai-usagebar-tui` open as a centered floating window, the same way Omarchy floats its own settings TUIs (Wi-Fi/`impala`, audio/`wiremix`, Bluetooth/`bluetui`), add this to `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` or any sourced `.conf`, such as `looknfeel.conf`:

```ini
# ai-usagebar TUI — float + center + fixed size. omarchy-launch-tui sets the
# app-id from the binary basename, so the class is org.omarchy.ai-usagebar-tui.
# 875x600 matches the size Omarchy gives its own `floating-window`-tagged TUIs.
windowrule = float on, match:class ^(org\.omarchy\.ai-usagebar-tui)$
windowrule = center on, match:class ^(org\.omarchy\.ai-usagebar-tui)$
windowrule = size 875 600, match:class ^(org\.omarchy\.ai-usagebar-tui)$
```

Then `hyprctl reload` (no logout needed).

> Omarchy tags a hardcoded list of TUI app-ids with `floating-window` in `~/.local/share/omarchy/default/hypr/apps/system.conf`, which then applies `float + center + size 875 600`. The rules above set those values directly, so the size is deterministic regardless of which config is sourced first. If you launch the TUI differently (e.g. `kitty -e ai-usagebar-tui`), replace the class regex with whatever `hyprctl clients` reports for your terminal.

> Hyprland 0.46+ uses the unified `windowrule` keyword with `match:…` filters.
> The older `windowrulev2 = …, class:…` syntax still works on legacy releases
> but is deprecated. Use the form above on current Omarchy and Hyprland.

## Provider coverage

The CLI and TUI support every provider in the authentication table above.
Native desktop coverage varies by integration. The
[provider endpoint reference](docs/vendor-endpoints.md) lists each endpoint,
reported metric, desktop selector, stability note, and live-test command.

Run `make smoke` to check live response shapes.

## Format placeholders

Use placeholders in `--format` and `--tooltip-format`:

```bash
ai-usagebar --vendor anthropic --format '{session_pct}% · {session_reset}'
ai-usagebar --vendor openrouter --format '${or_balance} remaining'
```

Shared claudebar placeholders and every provider-specific field are listed in
the [format placeholder reference](docs/format-placeholders.md).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the pre-PR gate, the checklist,
and the bar a new provider has to clear.

## Local development

```bash
ai-usagebar --watch 5                              # iterate on --format live
ai-usagebar --vendor openrouter --format '{or_balance} · today {or_used_today}'

make test                                          # unit + integration
source ~/.config/zsh/secrets                       # required for existing vendor smoke tests
make smoke                                         # runs all ignored tests; only Kimi skips without its key
make clippy                                        # cargo clippy -D warnings
```

## TUI controls

![ai-usagebar-tui showing the Codex tab — 5h and weekly gauges, Credits block with message-count ranges, tabs at top, key hints in the footer](screenshots/tui-openai.png)

- `Tab` / `l` / `→` — next tab
- `Shift+Tab` / `h` / `←` — previous tab
- `r` — refresh active tab
- `R` — refresh all tabs
- `s` — open Settings overlay (primary vendor + API keys)
- `c` — open local Claude context sessions (only when `[context] enabled = true`); `v` cycles its layout
- `q` / `Esc` / `Ctrl-C` — quit

The TUI refreshes every 60 seconds. During a refresh it keeps the current values
visible with a `↻` marker. If the request fails, the last snapshot remains on
screen and is marked stale.

OpenRouter uses the same layout for balance, usage by period, and account tier:

### Local context overlay

The optional context overlay answers a different local question from the
vendor tabs: how much input context was present in recent Claude Code sessions.
Enable it by hand, restart the TUI, and press `c`:

```toml
[context]
enabled = true
layout = "full"                          # full | split | bottom  (`v` cycles)
# projects_path = "~/.claude/projects"  # this is the default
# context_window_tokens = 200000         # optional fallback

# Exact model ids override the fallback when 200K and 1M sessions coexist.
[context.model_context_window_tokens]
"claude-opus-4-6" = 1000000
```

The default `full` layout replaces the dashboard body. Press `v` to cycle
through `full`, `split`, and `bottom` layouts.

- `↑`/`↓` or `j`/`k` selects a session.
- `Enter` opens its detail gauge.
- `Esc` returns and `r` rescans.

The percentage follows
[Claude Code's status-line definition](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline):
`input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens`. Without
a trustworthy model window size, the overlay shows tokens instead of guessing
a percentage. After compaction, it waits for the next assistant response before
calculating a new value.

The reader handles Claude Code's undocumented local JSONL defensively:

- it reads bounded tails from the 100 most recently modified top-level
  sessions;
- it ignores corrupt records and `subagents` sidechains;
- it does not follow discovered symlinks;
- it performs filesystem work off the UI thread.

When the feature is disabled, nothing under `~/.claude/projects` is read.
Context options remain in TOML rather than the Settings modal.

### Settings overlay

![Settings overlay floating over the TUI — Primary vendor radio (Claude selected), masked Z.AI API key (•••), masked OpenRouter API key (•••), Save button, key hints at bottom. This older screenshot predates later API-key providers described below.](screenshots/tui-settings.png)

Press `s` while the TUI is open. The overlay lets you:

- Pick the **primary vendor** that the widget defaults to and that the TUI selects on startup. Use `←` / `→` to cycle.
- Enter a key for any supported API-key provider. Keys are masked as you type;
  press `Ctrl-V` to reveal or hide them. The provider's configured environment
  variable still wins at runtime; the inline key is the fallback. Saving a
  non-empty key also sets that provider's `enabled = true`.

Key bindings inside the overlay:

- `Tab` / `↑↓` — move between fields
- `←` / `→` — cycle primary-vendor selection (only on the vendor field)
- `Ctrl-V` — toggle key visibility on the focused key field
- `Ctrl-S` — save and close
- `Esc` — discard and close

Save updates `~/.config/ai-usagebar/config.toml` through `toml_edit`, preserving
comments and unrelated settings. The file is set to mode `600`.

Omarchy's native QML form uses the same Rust persistence path and semantics.
It never loads stored key values into the long-lived shell process: blank means
unchanged, clear is explicit, and new values are sent to the binary over stdin.

After saving:

- TUI tabs fetch again immediately.
- Waybar modules configured with `signal: 13` refresh through `SIGRTMIN+13`.
- Other Waybar modules refresh on their next interval. Run
  `pkill -SIGUSR2 waybar` to force a full reload.

## Theming

- One Dark palette by default.
- Auto-merges with the active Omarchy theme at `~/.config/omarchy/current/theme/colors.toml`.
- Per-color overrides: `--color-low`, `--color-mid`, `--color-high`, `--color-critical` (claudebar-compatible).
